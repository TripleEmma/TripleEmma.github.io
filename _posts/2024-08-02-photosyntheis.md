Continuing with the leaf data analysis, one of the most critical physiological processes in plant leaves is photosynthesis. This led me to a specific question: How many photosynthesis-related genes are expressed in the leaf dataset I analyzed?

Naturally, I thought of the photosynthesis-related genes in Arabidopsis thaliana as a reference.

Surprisingly (again), I couldn’t find any study that directly lists the photosynthesis genes of Arabidopsis thaliana. However, identifying these genes using resources like Gene Ontology (GO) turned out to be straightforward. Here’s how I approached it:

- Navigate to Gene Ontology, a resource for exploring gene functions and their biological roles.
- Enter the keyword “Photosynthesis.”
- On the left-hand side, under “Organism,” select “Arabidopsis thaliana.”

This search yielded a total of 282 genes associated with photosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana.
